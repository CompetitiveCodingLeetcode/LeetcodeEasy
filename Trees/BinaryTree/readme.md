### Binary Tree
- data structures in which each node has at most two children, left and right children
- It is a family of data structure (BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black trees, Syntax tree)

### Why Binary Tree?
- prerequisite for more advanced trees like BST, AVL, Red Black Trees
- Huffman Coding Problem, Heap priority problem and expression parsing problems can be solved efficiently using binary trees

### Types of Binary Tree

- Full Binary Tree
    - If a node has zero children or two children
- Perfect Binary Tree
    - all nodes have exactly two children and leaf nodes are at same level
- Complete Binary Tree
    - last level is not completely filled
    - the nodes are as left as possible for the incomplete level
- Balanced Binary Tree
    - all leaf nodes are located from the root in the same distance
  
### Binary Tree
- Linked List
- Python List(array)

#### Linked List Representation
- each node has data, left reference and right reference.
