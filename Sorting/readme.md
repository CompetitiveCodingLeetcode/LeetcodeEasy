### For custom sorting
The following link contains the possible ways to do customized sorting using sorted() method: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/sorted-function-using-key-parameter-in-python-7aa9b8cebfb6

### Stable Sorting

- means if two elements are equal then the order in which the elements occur in original array is the same in sorted array too.

### in place sorting

- means no auxillary space is required for sorting.

## BUBBLE SORT

- insertion has better performance than bubble sort
- Advantage: It can detect whether the list is already sorted or not.
- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)
- Average case time complexity: O(n^2)
- Best case time complexity: O(n)
- Worst case space complexity: O(1)

## SELECTION SORT

- works well for sorting small files
- It is suitable for sorting large files with small keys because sorting is done based on keys  
- Advantage: In place sorting.
- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)
- Average case time complexity: O(n^2)
- Best case time complexity: O(n^2)
- Worst case space complexity: O(1)
