- there are three parts in recursion:
  - base case - required to exit
  - recurrence relation (call to itself)
  - processing - like print,update, increment etc.
### Types of Recursion
- Direct and indirect recursion
- Tail and non-tail(head) recursion
  - tail recursion is when recursive relation is called in end i.e., after processing
  - head recursion is when recursive relation is called before processing
