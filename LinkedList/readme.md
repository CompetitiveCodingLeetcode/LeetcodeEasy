### Linked List vs Arrays
- Elements of linked list are independent objects i.e., in linked list we can pick a node nad delete it and the memory reference also gets deleted but in an array if you delete an element thn the memory reference doesn't get deleted.
- size of linked list can vary
- insertion and removals in linked  list is very efficient.
- random access - accessing an element is very efficient in arrays

### types of Linked lists
1. Single linked list
2. circular single linked list
- Eample four player chess game - to iterate through each player's chance
3. Double linked list
- Example: forward and backward options for songs in playlist
4. Circular double linked list
- Example: CMD+Shift+Tab in MAC

### Linked List in Memory
- Linked list elements are stored non-contiguously in memory.
