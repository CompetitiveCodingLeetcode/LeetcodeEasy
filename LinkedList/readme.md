### Linked List vs Arrays
- Elements of linked list are independent objects i.e., in linked list we can pick a node nad delete it and the memory reference also gets deleted but in an array if you delete an element thn the memory reference doesn't get deleted.
- size of linked list can vary
- insertion and removals in linked  list is very efficient.
- random access - accessing an element is very efficient in arrays

### types of Linked lists
1. Single linked list
2. circular single linked list
- Example four player chess game - to iterate through each player's chance
3. Double linked list
- Example: forward and backward options for songs in playlist
4. Circular double linked list
- Example: CMD+Shift+Tab in MAC

### Linked List in Memory
- Linked list elements are stored non-contiguously in memory.

## Single Linked Lists

- Deleting the entire single linked list means removing the pointers to linkedd list if a particular node has no reference the garbage collector deletes that.

### Space and Time Complexity of Single Linked List

1. Creation:

- Time Complexity:O(1)
- Space Complexity:O(1)

2. Insertion:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Traversal:

- Time Complexity:O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Searching:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

5. Delete a Node:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

6. Deleting the linked List:

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity: O(1)



### Space and Time Complexity of Circular Single Linked List

1. Creation:

- Time Complexity:O(1)
- Space Complexity:O(1)

2. Insertion:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Traversal:

- Time Complexity:O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Searching:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

5. Delete a Node:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

6. Deleting the linked List:

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity: O(1)


### Space and Time Complexity of Double Linked List

1. Creation:

- Time Complexity:O(1)
- Space Complexity:O(1)

2. Insertion:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

3. Traversal:

- Time Complexity:O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

4. Searching:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

5. Delete a Node:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

6. Deleting the linked List:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
  
because if we make head reference to null still each node contains a reference in terms of the prev pointer

- Space Complexity: O(1)
