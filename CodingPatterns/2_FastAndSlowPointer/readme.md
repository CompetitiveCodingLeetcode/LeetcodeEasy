- The fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at different speeds, often to identify cycles or find a specific target.
- Due to the different speeds of the pointers, this pattern is also commonly known as the **Hare and Tortoise algorithm**, where the Hare is the fast pointer while Tortoise is the slow pointer.
- This approach enables the algorithm to detect specific properties within the data structure, such as cycles, midpoints, or intersections.
- Examples:
  - **Middle of the linked list**: Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
    - The idea is to iterate the fast and slow pointers such that initially both are pointing to first node.
    - the slow pointer moves by one step and the fast pointer moves by 2 steps .
    - If at any point fast pointer is null or fast pointer's next node is null, then the slow pointer points to middle of node.
  - **Detect cycle in an array**: Given an array of non-negative integers where elements are indexes pointing to the next element, determine if there is a cycle in the array.
    
### Does your problem match this pattern?
- Yes, if the following condition is fulfilled:
  - **Linear data structure**: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
- In addition, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
  - **Cycle or intersection detection**: The problem involves detecting a loop within a linked list or an array or involves finding an intersection between two linked lists or arrays.
  - **Find the starting element at the second quantile**: The problem involves finding the starting element of the second quantile, i.e., second half, second tertile, second quartile, etc. For example, the problem asks to find the middle element of an array or a linked list.

### Real world Problems:
- **Symlink verification**: A symbolic link, or symlink, is simply a shortcut to another file. Essentially, itâ€™s a file that points to another file. Symlinks can easily create loops or cycles where shortcuts point to each other. To avoid such occurrences, a symlink verification utility can be used, and fast and slow pointers are useful in that case.
- **Compiling an object-oriented program**: Compiling object-oriented programs often involves managing dependencies between various modules stored in separate files for easier maintenance. However, these dependencies can sometimes form cyclic relationships, leading to compilation errors. By employing the fast and slow pointers pattern, these cycles can be detected and resolved, ensuring smooth compilation and execution of the program.
