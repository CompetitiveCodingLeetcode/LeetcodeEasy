### Dynamic Programming
- There are 2 approaches in DP:
  - Top-Down Approach: Recursion + Memoization
  - Bottom-Up Approach: Tabulation method

- We try to solve a problem by DP when we are trying to find optimal solution to a bigger problem by using the optimal solution of its sub problems
- there should be overlapping sub problems to solve a problem using DP
- store the value of sub problems is k/a memoization
