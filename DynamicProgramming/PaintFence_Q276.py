"""
You are painting a fence of n posts with k different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:

Every post must be painted exactly one color.
There cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.
Given the two integers n and k, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.



Example 1:


Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.
Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there cannot be three posts in a row with the same color.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50
1 <= k <= 105
The testcases are generated such that the answer is in the range [0, 231 - 1] for the given n and k.


APPROACH:
For colouring n posts with no more than 2 posts with same colour using k colours:
1. check 2 cases for n=2 where both posts are coloured same and secondly, both posts are of different colors.
2. Extend n=2 to n=3 and try to link with n=2.
3. Same of n=3 is linked to diff of n=2 and diff of n=3 is linked to total of n=2.
4. Further, extend the logic to n=4 and youâ€™ll get recursive relation
