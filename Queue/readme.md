### QUEUE
- it is a data structure that stores items in FIFO manner.


### opeartions in Queue
- Creating Queues
- Enqueue()
- Dequeue()
- peek(), delete(), isEmpty(), isFull()
- delete queue

### Implementation in Queue
1. Python List
    - Queue without capacity
    - Queue with capacity(Circular Queue)
    
2. Linked List

### Time and Space complexity for Queue
1. Create Queue
   - Time Complexity - O(1)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
2. Enqueue
   - Time Complexity - O(n)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
3. Dequeue
   - Time Complexity - O(n)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
4. Peek
   - Time Complexity - O(1)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
5. isEmpty
   - Time Complexity - O(1)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
6. Delete Entire Queue
   - Time Complexity - O(1)
   - Space Complexity - O(1)
